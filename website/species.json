They hatch in the freshwater of rivers and spend most of their time in the estuaries of these rivers. Unlike Atlantic sturgeon, shortnose sturgeon tend to spend relatively little time in the ocean. When they do enter marine waters, they generally stay close to shore. In the spring, adults move far upstream and away from saltwater to spawn. After spawning, the adults move rapidly back downstream to the estuaries, where they feed, rest, and spend most of their time.\nShortnose sturgeon have five rows of external, bony plates along the length of their body known as scutes, giving them the appearance they are covered in armor. Shortnose sturgeon are slow-growing and late-maturing, and they have been recorded to reach up to 4.5 feet in length and live 30 years or more.\nNative American fishermen harvested shortnose and Atlantic sturgeon for their meat and eggs (roe) beginning some 4,000 years ago, and sturgeon are credited as the primary food source that saved the Jamestown settlers in 1607. In the mid-1800s, Atlantic and shortnose sturgeon began to support a thriving and profitable fishery for caviar, smoked meat, and oil. For the most part, historical landings records failed to differentiate between shortnose sturgeon and the larger Atlantic sturgeon, making it difficult to determine historical trends in abundance for populations of either species. By the late-1800s, sturgeon were being over-exploited. In 1890, over 7 million pounds of sturgeon were caught in 1 year alone. In 1920, only 23,000 pounds of sturgeon were caught.\nAlthough shortnose sturgeon are no longer fished, threats remain that continue to affect recovery efforts. Bycatch in commercial fisheries and increased industrial uses of the nation\u2019s large coastal rivers during the 20th century (e.g., hydropower, nuclear power, treated sewage disposal) became the primary barriers to shortnose sturgeon recovery.\nToday, the shortnose sturgeon is in danger of extinction throughout its range and is listed as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act. The primary threats to this species are habitat degradation, water pollution, dredging, water withdrawals, fisheries bycatch, and habitat impediments (e.g., dams).\nNOAA Fisheries and its partners are dedicated to conserving and rebuilding shortnose sturgeon populations along the East Coast. We use a variety of innovative techniques to study, protect, and recover these endangered fish. Working closely with our partners, we develop regulations and management plans that preserve and restore sturgeon habitat, monitor bycatch, and promote population recovery.\nDistribution\nHistorically, shortnose sturgeon were found in the coastal rivers along the East Coast of North America\u2014from the Saint John River in New Brunswick, Canada, to the St. Johns River in Florida, and perhaps as far south as the Indian River in Florida. Currently, shortnose sturgeon can be found in 41 bays and rivers along the East Coast, but their distribution across this range is broken up, with a large gap of about 250 miles separating the northern and mid-Atlantic metapopulations from the southern metapopulation. (A metapopulation is a group of separate but interacting populations such that there is gene flow occurring among the populations.) Because of this distance between the shortnose sturgeon in mid-Atlantic/northern metapopulations and the southern metapopulation, adults from the two regions may never meet to breed.\nIn the southern metapopulation, shortnose sturgeon are currently found in the Great Pee Dee, Waccamaw, Edisto, Cooper, Altamaha, Ogeechee, and Savannah rivers. They may also be found in the Black, Sampit, Ashley, Santee, Roanoke, and Cape Fear rivers, as well as Albemarle Sound and Pamlico Sound. Shortnose sturgeon used to be considered extinct in the Satilla, St. Marys, and the St. Johns rivers, but were recently found again in both the Satilla and St. Marys rivers. A single specimen was found in the St. Johns River by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission during extensive sampling of the river in 2002 and 2003; subsequent sampling by a different group in 2014 and 2015 found no shortnose sturgeon.\nIn the northern and mid-Atlantic metapopulations, shortnose sturgeon are currently found in the Saint John (Canada), Penobscot, Kennebec, Androscoggin, Piscataqua, Merrimack, Connecticut, Hudson, Delaware, and Potomac rivers. They have also been frequently spotted opportunistically foraging and transiting in the St. George, Medomak, Damariscotta, Sheepscot, Saco, Deerfield, East, and Susquehanna rivers. On rare occasions, they have been seen in the Narraguagus, Presumpscot, Westfield, Housatonic, Schuylkill, Rappahannock, and James rivers.\nThere are also two dam-locked populations of shortnose sturgeon that were trapped upstream of dams upon completion of their construction. Populations can be found above the Holyoke Dam on the Connecticut River.\u00a0 In South Carolina, shortnose sturgeon are also trapped in Lake Moultrie and Lake Marion above the dams on the Santee-Cooper river system (i.e., Pinopolis, Wilson, and St. Stephens dams).

With a few exceptions, groundfish live on or near the bottom of the ocean. Fishermen from Washington, Oregon, and California catch them year-round using a variety of gear types. These stocks are harvested in both non-tribal and tribal commercial fisheries and recreational fisheries. NOAA Fisheries and the Pacific Fishery Management Council\u00a0oversee the management of West Coast groundfish in U.S. federal waters.\nPopulation Status\nGroundfish populations on the West Coast have rebounded from lows experienced in the 1990s. Measures including closed areas, reduced catch limits, and a shift to \u201ccatch shares\u201d management were implemented. As a result, the recovery of some rockfish species has occurred more than a decade earlier than the timeline estimated by scientists. Today, most of the 90 plus stocks managed under the West Coast groundfish fisheries are not overfished and are not experiencing overfishing. The following stock is making progress towards being rebuilt:\nYelloweye rockfish (rebuilding; not experiencing overfishing); target rebuilding year: 2029.\nFor updated information, view our Fishery Stock Status Updates.\nAppearance\nGroundfish generally fall into one of the following categories of fish:\nRockfish: Numerous species, including widow, yellowtail, canary, and vermilion rockfish; bocaccio, chilipepper, cowcod, yelloweye, thornyheads, and Pacific ocean perch.\nFlatfish: 12 species including petrale sole, Dover sole, starry flounder, arrowtooth flounder, and Pacific sanddab.\nRoundfish: The six species are lingcod, cabezon, kelp greenling, Pacific cod, Pacific whiting (hake), and sablefish.\nSharks and skates: The six species are leopard shark, soupfin shark, spiny dogfish, big skate, California skate, and longnose skate.\nOther species: These include ratfish, finescale codling, and Pacific rattail grenadier.\nBiology\nGroundfish are commonly associated at some part of their lives with the ocean floor. While most groundfish share this characteristic, a wide variety of life history traits can be found. Some species are long-lived, with life spans exceeding 30 years. in some extreme cases they may reach ages of 100 years or greater. Longer-lived species tend to produce fewer offspring that grow to adulthood, but have other life history traits for coping with environmental variability. Species with shorter life expectancies tend to have more variable reproductive success. They experience more pronounced \u201cboom and bust\u201d population dynamics. Life history information continues to be evaluated and incorporated into the stock assessments which provide the basis for fishery management decisions.\nWhere They Live\nMost species are coastwide stocks. Some of them vary in concentration from north to south, and some are common from the U.S./Canada border to the U.S./Mexico border. Groundfish inhabit a variety of depths, ranging from intertidal and nearshore to waters as deep as 3,500 meters (1,900 fathoms). Most individual species tend to localize by depth more than latitude.\nManagement Highlights\nIn 2011, NOAA Fisheries and the Council implemented \u201ccatch shares\u201d management for portions of the commercial fishery. Catch shares allocates each fisherman a share of the allowable catch, as determined by scientific data. The Groundfish Trawl Catch Share Program freed fishermen from having to race each other to catch the most fish. The management change resulted in a substantial reduction in discarded catch. It led to the full rebuilding of several groundfish species, some of them a decade or more ahead of expectations.\nInformation on ongoing management changes for all groundfish fisheries is available on our Compliance Guides\u00a0page.\nRelated Fisheries\nSablefish\nPacific Whiting\nPacific Halibut\nAdditional Management Resources\nWest Coast Fisheries Permits\nWest Coast Groundfish Commercial Fisheries\nWest Coast Groundfish Recreational Fisheries\nFishWatch\nContact Us\nFor questions related to West Coast groundfish regulations, contact the West Coast Region\u2019s Groundfish Branch at (206) 526-6140.\nFor questions related to West Coast groundfish permits and licenses or the associated forms, please contact the NOAA Fisheries Permit Office at (206) 526-4353.\nSign-up to\u00a0receive bulletins and notices by email.

But despite its fearsome reputation, its large size and low productivity (reproductive rates, growth rates, age at maturity, longevity, etc.) make the white shark vulnerable to declines from human impacts. Due to these natural vulnerabilities, the white shark is one of the most widely protected sharks globally.\nThe white shark is also one of the most well-studied shark species in the world, including its populations off the east and west coasts of the United States. Seasonal aggregations in key feeding areas along the coast allows researchers to study them.
